What time is it?
Tom and Jack come out of the cinema.It is very late.
"I can't find my watch.Where is it?"Tom says.
"Is it in your bag?"Jack asks.
"Oh,yes.Here it is."
"What time is it?"
"My watch doesn't work.Let's sing,and then we can know the time."
"Why?"
"Just do it."
The two boys begin to sing.A short time later ,a man in the building opens the window and shouts,"Keep it down!Don't you know it's three o'clock in the morning?"
